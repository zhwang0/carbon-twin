## Benchmarks
The repository includes codes for the following methods:
- **LSTM**: A standard LSTM taking time-series ED inputs and outputting targets ([Graves, 2012](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/phd.pdf)).
- **LSTNet**: A time-series model extracting short-term dependency using convolution along the time-feature dimension and long-term temporal patterns using RNN ([Lai et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015)).
- **DeepED**: An LSTM-based deep learning emulator for ED with specialized designs on error accumulation reduction and knowledge-guided learning ([Wang et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3589132.3625577)).
- **Transformer (TF)**: A vanilla transformer model with a self-attention mechanism to capture dependencies across all time steps during the forecasting ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).
- **Informer (IF)**: A transformer variant with a ProbSparse attention for reduced complexity ([Zhou et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436)).
- **DLinear (DL)**: A linear decomposition model to separate data into trend and seasonality, showing comparable performance among transformer-based models while maintaining efficiency ([Zeng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504)).
- **Crossformer (CF)**: A transformer variant with a two-stage attention mechanism for modeling both cross-time and cross-feature dependencies ([Zhang et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vSVLM2j9eie)).
